			<h2> My hobby is coding apps, websites, etc in my free time. Whenever I feel bored I always do coding after my homework. <br>
				I am 10 years old and read in 5th class. Now I know well that coding helps to increase our memory, problem-solving skill, and cognitive skills as well. Coding exercises can activate the brain's learning centers. Coding can keep one busy, concentrated, and cheerful.
				<br>
				Coding is a good source of enjoyment, concentration, and computer technology. It makes us aware of the future, helps us in future and knowledge but what I feel is most important is successful
